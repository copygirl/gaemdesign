# Introduction

This is a design documentation for my dream game and ideas I would like to realize in it, regardless of feasibility. Since the game has yet to have been made, except for a couple of fruitless attempts at creating an engine of sorts that would support it, as well as my perfectionism, I figured I'd at the very least would create this document / repository to write down my design ideas as detailed as I can.

Note that I have absolutely no problem if anyone were to take inspiration or straight up implement some or all of these ideas into their own game. I'm very much a proponent for sharing ideas and I believe more implementations allow greater refinement and remixing which allows for even more impressive games to be made! (Not to mention the low probability that I will actually do this.)

For the curious, there's also an [older design document][DesignDoc] for the same basic game idea which you're free to check out. It may not 100% reflect my current ideas and goals, but it currently contains some information not yet present here, so it may still be of interest to you.

## Core Ideas

- **Open source**, open development and modding friendly
- **First-person** with own character model visible when looking down, holding items and performing actions.
- **Multiplayer voxel sandbox** with survival aspects. Block grid size is 1mÂ³.
- Focus on **progression** and **collaboration** with in-depth **crafting**, **customization** and **building**. Things take time, though ideally without unjustified grinding.
- **No GUIs** and minimal to no HUDs. Crafting and storage is done in-world.
- **No character progression / stats / skills** that would artificially gate players from accessing content or give them invisible numerical advantages over other players. You progress by gaining access to new tools and technology. You "level up" by improving your motor skills, knowledge and experience as a player, rather than a character.

## Settings

This document mainly outlines a game more focused on a medieval survival fantasy setting, possibly sneaking into the territory of steampunk and magic as late-game content. Likely with very little to no pre-made civilization beyond what players will construct in their time.

Yet I also yearn for an apocalyptic style setting that has players exploring vast semi-destroyed cityscapes, scrapping old machinery and electronics for raw resources to advance. I mention this as lots of the mechanics could be shared between both games.

## Tiers

- Stone
- Copper
- Bronze
- Iron
- Brass
- Steel

# Combat

- When charging up to fire an arrow with a bow, swiping the mouse as you shoot will give it some "spin", causing it to arc towards that direction. Might not be realistic but definitely pretty cool.
