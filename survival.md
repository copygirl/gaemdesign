## Health

Instead of a single scalar value as health, create a system in using which
multiple wounds and other negative status effects can affect your ability to do
certain tasks.

Instead of dying, there could be a state of unconsciousness before a character
would die for good. Blood loss, poisons, lack of oxygen, concussions and
perhaps pain itself could cause you to lose consciousness. All of these factors
would be calculated together to decide whether you're close. For example if you
were to start running after having lost some blood from a wound you took from
falling some distance, the additional lack of oxygen could put you over the
egde and you might pass out.

Time heals all wounds, though caring for your injuries, through applying
healing balms or bandages will greatly shorten the time for this to happen.
Healthy, high quality food, will also slightly speed things up the healing
process as well, regardless of whether you ate before or after taking damage.
