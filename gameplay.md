## Controls

### Basic movement

| Key      | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Mouse`  | Look around. Depending on your current action and held object, character turn speed might be limited. |
| `WASD`   | Walk. |
| `Space`  | Hold to jump higher, then release. Slows you down while you're charging your jump. |
| `Shift`  | Sprint. Uses stamina, similar to other actions. |
| `Ctrl`   | Walk / sneak (different animation depending on stance). Reduces the amount of sound you make. |
| `Tab`    | Switch stances (**Passive** / **Combat**). Draws the weapons you were holding last or puts them away if possible. |
| `Tab` x2 | Switch to **Combat** stance and draw sheathed / equipped weapons, dropping whatever you were holding. |

### Advanced Movement

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `Q` / `E` | Leaning. Allows you to look around corners, just sticking out your head. (Only in **Passive** stance?) |
| `Ctrl` + `Shift` | Hold for some time to start crawling. Automatically exits **Combat** stance. Hold `Space` to stand up again. |
| `Shift` + `WASD` x2 | Short dash, with minor short slowdown afterwards. |
| `Shift` + `WASD` x2 ➡ `Space` | Long dash, with medium, slightly longer slowdown afterwards? |
| `WASD` x2 ➡ `Ctrl` | Roll? |

Depending on your equipment and held objects, certain movement options might not be available or you will be slowed down, for example when carrying a heavy object.

### Hand Interaction / Held Objects

Character is two-handed, each mouse button controls one hand. It is possible to carry large and/or heavy objects with both hands. Different modifier keys affect how the held object is used. The modifier key only needs to be held when you press the mouse button. You may let go off the key afterwards to prepare a different type of action.

| Modifier           | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| None (Passive)     | Use. (This will never hurt entities to avoid accidents.) |
| None (Combat)      | Attack. Hold to **charge**. (Move mouse to **swipe** a certain direction?) |
| **Interact** (`F`) | Pick up / place down / switch. Highlights possible objects to interact with. Depending on the size / weight of the object, this may take some time. |
| **Throw** (`T`)    | Drop. Hold to **throw**. Distance depends on weight. |

Pressing **Interact** followed by clicking both mouse buttons, the objects in your hands will be swapped out with each other. Holding the mouse buttons will instead attempt to use both objects together. (Such as combining them, or taking an item out of a pouch with an empty hand, ...)

For most items, an ongoing action, especially ones that are charged up and are waiting for you to release the mouse button, can be cancelled by pressing the other mouse button at the same time. As such, there's only very few special items which may be used at the same time.

One exception to this rule is for example shields. Another item can be used while the shield is being used (held up to block). However, if you're charging an attack, pressing the button for the shield will cancel that attack, instead.

For objects held with both hands, both buttons must be held down.
